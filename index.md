## Ian Collier

I'm a Computer Science student at Oregon State University. Below are a selection of my personal and class projects I think best represent my work and interests.

### Class Projects

#### Intro to Computer Graphics Final
[[GitHub](https://github.com/ian-collier-osu/cs450-final)] An interactive, lifelike 3D "virtual face" created in OpenGL.

#### Cloud Application Development Final

[[GitHub](https://github.com/ian-collier-osu/cs493-final)] A large set of CRUDs API for managing a database that simulates tracking boats stored in slips. Created with NodeJS Express and Google Datastore, with OAuth2 logins for API authorization.  

#### Intro to Databases Final

[[GitHub](https://github.com/ian-collier-osu/CS340-Group-Project)] An extensive SQL database schema for managing a simulated car repair shop. The database is implemented in a set of web APIs with a corresponding management frontend.

#### Web Development Final

[[GitHub](https://github.com/ian-collier-osu/cs290-final)] A React frontend for a mock cloud storage company with a UI designed to look like a real production website.

### Open Source Projects

#### md2pdf-rust

[[GitHub](https://github.com/ap4sc/md2pdf-rust)] A lightweight command-line tool for converting Markdown into PDF documents, written in Rust.

#### genpdf-rs (contributor)

[[Source Hut](https://git.sr.ht/~ap4sc/genpdf-rs/)] A Rust library for programmatic, high-level generation of PDF documents. I added several formatting features needed by `md2pdf-rust` in my own fork, on most of which I collaborated with the [project creator](https://git.sr.ht/~ireas/) to integrate into the original.
